# work in progress combined fork of figgyc's [bracketcounter](https://github.com/figgyc/bracketcounter) and [bracketcounter-web](https://github.com/figgyc/bracketcounter-web)

- client side has been revamped in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to allow for a modular data visualization system.
- server side now uses [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) subscriptions to allow for flexible real-time updates. probably slower though

IDK if the .nix or docker stuff works on this fork, sorry :(
